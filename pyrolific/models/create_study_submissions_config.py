    """**BETA**: This is a beta feature and is currently only available to selected workspaces.
    It is being tested and evaluated for effectiveness and user experience before being released to all users.

    **Advanced**: This helps with faster data collection. Your survey system will need to handle providing a
    unique experience each time the participant takes the study.

    Configuration related to study submissions. The purpose of this field is to capture any configuration options that
    impact the submissions made by participants in a study.

        Attributes:
            max_submissions_per_participant (Union[Unset, None, int]): - **1** is the default Prolific experience. This
                means one submission, per participant, per study. If you do
                  not specify this field, the **default is 1**.
                - **1+** turns your study into a multi-submission study, meaning a participant can create many submissions per
                study.
                  As noted above, your survey system will need to handle providing a
                unique experience each time the participant takes the study.
                - **-1** will allow an indefinite number of submissions from a single participant, up to
                `total_available_places`. Default: 1.
            max_concurrent_submissions (Union[Unset, None, int]): - **-1** is the default value, meaning unlimited
                concurrent active/reserved submissions per study.
                - **1+** limits the number of concurrent active/reserved submissions a study can have at one time. Default: -1.
