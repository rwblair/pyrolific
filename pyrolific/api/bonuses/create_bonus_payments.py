    r"""Set up bonuses

     Set up bonus payments to one or more participants/submissions in a study.

    You need the study id, the participant|submission ids and the request in CSV format.

    The csv_bonuses field needs to be structured in the format of either:

    - `<participant_id>,<amount>\n`.
    - `<submission_id>,<amount>\n`.

    Setting up a bonus payment does not actually pay them, to do so check [/api/v1/bulk-bonus-
    payments/{id}/pay/](#tag/Bonuses/paths/~1api~1v1~1bulk-bonus-payments~1%7Bid%7D~1pay~1/post)

    The submission and participant IDs need to have taken part in the study in order for this call to be
    successful.
    If not, you will get a \"400\" HTTP response back, which explains which IDs are incorrect.

    Args:
        authorization (str):

    Raises:
        errors.UnexpectedStatus: If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
